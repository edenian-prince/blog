<section id="days-later-showed-that-love-is-the-cure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="days-later-showed-that-love-is-the-cure">28 Days Later showed that love is the cure</h2>
<p>We need to draw a line through the first movie up until this one for me to stay on track. 28 Days Later shows that the rage virus doesn’t just affect whoever is infected, but its hate and rage affects everyone. <strong>Hannah and Jim help Selena make the connection that love really is the cure.</strong></p>
<p>The rage virus comes from society and its hate, its wars, its chaos. Even if there is love, the virus affects everyone and spreads fast. Just like IRL, hate online or in the street does affect us all. Selena struggles with this in the beginning - she rightfully doesn’t trust anyone, and it affects her relationships and kills her ability to actually live. When you’re surrounded by hate you have no choice but to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Hannah breaks this mentality. She shows Selena that they all need each other and that they all need to trust each other. And Jim shows her that “just” staying alive isn’t “as good as it gets”, but that openning up and loving is worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Selena becomes aware of what it means to live</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="samson-adam-and-eve" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="samson-adam-and-eve">Samson, Adam and Eve</h2>
<p>In part one of 28 Years Later, Dr.&nbsp;Kelson treats the infected like the humans they really are while the rest of humanity abandons them and treats them like demons. He shows Spike how to have a healthy view of death and life. How to love. Spike’s journey shows that even if we’re in a ‘safe’ society, shielded from the outside horrors, we will still always be affected by the horrors outside unless we face them. Society can’t be segregated. If one group falls apart we all do.</p>
<p>In the Bone Temple, Dr.&nbsp;Kelson begins to experiment with teaching Samson how to love. He shows him art, music, dance, and he speaks to him. Even if it feels that Samson can’t hear him, he tells him stories. We start to see Samson change: he doesn’t kill Kelson, but keeps coming back for more. We might be tempted to think that this is addiction, that Samson really just cares about the morphine that Kelson tranquilizes him with, but in the midst of his high, we see Samson remember.</p>
<p>Samson shows his first sign of awareness when he eats a blackberry (it seemed he was a meat eater prior to this) and wipes his hand on his cloth. And the cloth shows that he’s aware of his penis now and tries to cover it up. This is like the story of Adam and Eve where the devil tells Eve that if she eats the fruit she will not die, but she will gain awareness of good and evil.</p>
<p>But this time it isn’t a woman that gains consciousness. It’s a man. I think that is key to this new series; we’re shown that the old society values toxic masculinity; Jamie (although he is complicated and a caring father), kills without emotion, cheats on his wife, they call the infected things like “Alpha” because their muscles and big dicks.. and Eric the scandinavian soldier that tries to act tough saying he is a viking. Eric even shows how he feels about women, showing off to Spike about the woman he had and how he prioritizes her for her looks. Samson gaining consciousness here shows us that society needs to change its view of masculinity. <strong>And that women have already woken up, but now it’s men who need to wake up</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="dr.-kelson-jimmy-love-art-and-religion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dr.-kelson-jimmy-love-art-and-religion">Dr.&nbsp;Kelson, Jimmy, love, art, and religion</h2>
<p>We contrast Samson’s Adam and Eve moment with Kelson saying he’s atheist and Jimmy losing touch with reality by trying to cling to religion, either by god in his childhood or by the devil after he felt that god betrayed him. He’a trying to cling to a higher power to find truth amongst the chaos and unexplained. Kelson found that, religion aside, it’s love and patience and constant effort/experimenting with how to show that love that can cure someone of hate. Yes, science cured Samson, but I believe it had to be mixed with Kelson’s constant love and patience. It could not have happened in a cold laboratory. And I’m not sure if this is a flat out denouncement of religion, but gives us hope that we don’t have to cling to a higher power (whether satan or god) to heal ourselves. We can solve this with love and patience, and a little science.</p>
<p>I feel bad for Jimmy. He was just as affected by the virus as the actual infected. There’s a moment when he opens up and tells Kelson he feels heard, that nobody has really listened to him like Kelson. If Kelson had more time with Jimmy, I believe he would have cured him like he cured Samson.</p>
<p>He needed a role model like Kelson so badly, <strong>just like men right now that need better role models</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="jim" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jim">Jim</h2>
<p>The ending to The Bone Temple hit me hard. We find Jim teaching his daughter everything we’ve learned in the whole series.</p>
<div class="box">
<p><strong>“Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it,”</strong></p>
</div>
<p>They discuss how fascism brought hate into the world and how we cannot forget, or else the cycle with repeat. <strong>Our toxic masculine culture breeds fascists.</strong> It isolates men, tells them to blame women and minorities, teaches them to hate. It teaches them that there is somehow “peace through war”.</p>
<p>And in the last shot, Jim’s daughter asks if we should help those in danger of being infected by the rage, and he replies:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>“Of course we do.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

  <title>Prevent Credential Leaks w/ Git Hooks</title>
  <link>https://github.com/edenian-prince/blog/posts/2025-11-22-git-find/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 

<script src="../../assets/navbar_cells.js"></script>





<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I made a cli tool in rust that sets up pre-commit hooks and prevents credentials from being leaked in a repo. There are many tools like it, but I haven’t found any that can set up automated credential updates as easily. If there are tools out there that have that capability, please let me know! I think my tool is useful if you need to set up pre-commit hooks for beginner git users, but am open to learning about other tools.</p>

<section id="comparison-to-aws-git-secrets" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparison-to-aws-git-secrets">Comparison to AWS Git Secrets</h2>
<section id="git-secrets-doesnt-work-like-i-expect-out-of-the-box" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="git-secrets-doesnt-work-like-i-expect-out-of-the-box">git-secrets doesn’t work like I expect out of the box</h3>
<p>After installing git-secrets and git-find, we can see that out of the box git-secrets doesn’t apply git hooks globally to <em>existing</em> repos. I have to manually adjust that on my own. That could be a good thing for experienced users that want local hooks first, but when we’re setting up hooks for new git users where the main concern is security leaks, we just want to apply the hooks to ALL of their repositories and not worry about them needing to potentially adjust their git settings.</p>
<p>and to note, with git-secrets I added the provider like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">git</span> secrets <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--add-provider</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--global</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--</span> cat ./secrets_key</span></code></pre></div>
<p>with git-find it’s just</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">git-find</span> add-provider <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--path</span> /path/to/secrets.txt</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="quarto-video"><video id="video_shortcode_videojs_video1" class="video-js vjs-default-skin vjs-fluid" controls="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}" title=""><source src="images/commit.mp4"></video></div>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="git-find-can-auto-update-the-secret-provider" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="git-find-can-auto-update-the-secret-provider">git-find can auto update the secret provider</h3>
<p>With git-secrets I had to remind my teammates to manually update their regex provider files every time there was a new addition. For example, our team would add a new server to our workflow and we would need to add a regex to the provider list in order to prevent that server name from being accidentally hardcoded into the git repo.</p>
<p>This is a huge pain and a security risk to rely on asking git newbies to update their hook files. git-find does all of this automatically under the hood, and it lets you store your secrets file in a centralized location to ensure all of the team has access to the exact same hooks and recieve updates automatically.</p>
<div class="quarto-video"><video id="video_shortcode_videojs_video2" class="video-js vjs-default-skin vjs-fluid" controls="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}" title=""><source src="images/auto2.mp4"></video></div>
<p>Under the hood, when you add a provider:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">git-find</span> add-provider <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--path</span> /path/to/secrets.txt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It will prompt the user to set up auto updates if the provider is in a local git repo. If the user inputs Yes, it will run <code>git pull /secrets/repo/</code> to pull the latest updates whenever the user runs <code>git commit</code>, ensuring that they have the latest security updates</p>
</section>
<section id="history-scanning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="history-scanning">history scanning</h3>
<p>This is still a work in progress. Eventually I want to make a script that puts the secret scan results in a dataframe where the user can easily parse for any security leaks in a repo.</p>
<p>In the past I had some issues with git-secrets scanning tools. Not sure why, but it would take forever to scan big repos I think git-find has it sorted out, but it obviously doesn’t look faster here. I will continue to test and update this.</p>
<div class="quarto-video"><video id="video_shortcode_videojs_video3" class="video-js vjs-default-skin vjs-fluid" controls="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}" title=""><source src="images/scan.mp4"></video></div>

  <title>28 Years Later: movie review</title>
  <dc:creator>Frank Aragona</dc:creator>
  <link>https://github.com/edenian-prince/blog/posts/2025-10-20-28-years-later/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 

<script src="../../assets/navbar_cells.js"></script>





<p><img src="https://github.com/edenian-prince/blog/posts/2025-10-20-28-years-later/images/pals.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<div class="box">
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jimmy didn’t leave the power ranger behind, he became it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you watched this movie, you know that the ending is divisive. Either love it or hate it. I’ve been watching a lot of analyses on Jimmy’s character and I think a lot of them completely miss the point.</p>
<p>Spike’s journey has two parts; 1) he learns about death/life, and 2) what it means to be a man. The characters in the movie offer their perspectives to teach him about the two topics: His father has a somewhat toxic perspective of what makes someone a man — he kills without emotion, he says the infected are soulless, he isolates from his wife, cheats, drinks his emotions away, and copes. He is the one that labels the muscular, bid dick infected as “alphas”. Contrarily, when we meet the doctor, we see a healthy take on what it is to be human. He doesn’t think the infected are soulless, he doesn’t shy away from death (specifically with Isla, unlike Jaime), and he doesn’t call them ‘alpha’. He treats them like they’re living beings, as they are.</p>
<p>All of this shows Spike what life and death are, and that his community is actually a toxic and a regressed society. He would rather live than waste away in a toxic community, like what Dr.&nbsp;Kelson taught him.</p>
<p>Now jump to the ending. Jimmy shows up and it feels like we’re thrown into a completely different movie, pissing off a lot of viewers. But Jimmy is essential to the point of the film. Jimmy drives all of the lessons home.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Spike doesn’t pack his power ranger toy because it’s not what the society would label as ‘manly’. He thinks bringing it would be too boyish and immature. Jimmy contrasts that by showing that not only did he ‘pack the power ranger’, he metaphorically became one. This is where analyses break down and say “he never grew up, he’s still a child” or “this is how he copes” but I don’t buy either of them.</p>
<p>The whole movie presented us these toxic and traumatic perceptions of what it means to be an ‘alpha’ and shows us that it’s important to face death, cherish life, and stay true to who you are.</p>
<p>And Jimmy embodies the message. His appearance doesn’t make him less of a man. He obliterates the perception of what is ‘alpha’ and what it is to be a man (and really, obliterates gender norms. He’s wearing a tiara on purpose..). Jimmy doesn’t follow what his dad taught him (symbolized by the upside down cross), and he faces death head on. Jaime is not an ‘alpha’, whatever that means. He feeds us a bullshit view about masculinity but deep down he cannot face death or cherish life. Not only does Jimmy face death, but he clearly lives life to its fullest.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy is not coping; the film critics are.</strong></p>

<p>Typst in Quarto doesn’t work like latex. Instead of adding simple .tex partials to adjust minor things, you need to adjust .typ files.</p>

<h1>Multilingual Quarto</h1>
<p>I made a simple workflow for translating the text of a qmd file (or really any md file) into a new language. I’ll use English to Spanish as an example.</p>
</section>
<section id="hugging-face-transformers" class="level1">
<h1>🤗 Hugging Face Transformers</h1>
<p>The first step is to find a model that can translate into whatever language we want. I looked into a few different apis (like Google, DeepL), but they all required a credit card on file (even free versions), an api token, and they all have a tier approach where you can only make so many api calls.</p>
<p>I wanted to <strong>simplfy everything</strong> and avoid putting my credit card into any browser. Queue <strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index">Hugging Face Transformers</a></strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you the time and resources required to train a model from scratch. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>📝 Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation. 🖼️ Computer Vision: image classification, object detection, and segmentation. 🗣️ Audio: automatic speech recognition and audio classification. 🐙 Multimodal: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.</p>

<section id="code-to-use-transformers" class="level1">
<h1>Code to use Transformers</h1>
<p>There is an <a href="https://github.com/farach/huggingfaceR">R library for hugging face</a>, but I think it requires conda to install some python libraries and I had conda issues, so I just made a <a href="https://github.com/edenian-prince/translatemd">more simple package</a> that uses pip to install the python dependencies. And this package is really only for translation and for this demo.</p>
<p>I originally did all of this in Python, but decided to convert everything I could into R because parsing an md file is surprisingly (or unsurprisingly?) way more straightforward in R, and that’s where the real magic happens.</p>

<h1>Bugs</h1>
<p>I’ve caught a few bugs to this approach and you maybe even noticed some!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A <code>#</code> got removed in the translate - look at the section called <code>Automating the Release Cycle</code>. Since the <code>#</code> got removed it is no longer a header ☹️</li>
<li>The <code>lightparser</code> package has <a href="https://github.com/ThinkR-open/lightparser/issues/13">a reported bug</a> with quarto chunk yaml parameters. Here it converted <code>#| eval: false</code> into <code>#| eval: no</code>, but we know that the <code>#| eval: false</code> should not be treated as text. Hopefully this is fixed</li>
</ol>
<p>I recommend going through the document and looking for bugs like these! Some manual edits to the translated qmd file may be necessary.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://closeread.dev/gallery/demos/ojs-variables/">closeread docs for ojs are great</a> - I highly recommend reading through that document.</p>
<p>They use <code>crProgressBlock</code> as a variable to indicate how far along the page a user has scrolled.</p>
<p>They then take that variable and apply some basic math to it. For example, when the user starts scrolling at 0%, they set the variable <code>angle1</code> to be <code>-180</code>. And <code>angle1</code> will change as the user scrolls down until it gets to angle = <code>0</code>. Like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb2-1">angleScale1 = d3.scaleLinear()</span>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Structure of d3-force simulations Before we dive into the specific forces that we’ll use, let’s briefly discuss the general structure used to create a force-directed graph.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>// 1. create a copy of the node data <code>nodes = node_data.map(d =\&gt; Object.create(d))</code></p>
<p>// 2. create new force simulation specifying the forces to use // and, in our case, how many “ticks” or frames we’ll want to simulate</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb4-1">sim = d3.forceSimulation(nodes) .force("force_name", ...) // ... chain together as many forces as we want .stop() .tick(n_frames_to_simulate)</span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>// 3. bind data and draw nodes <code>node = svg.selectAll(".node") .data(nodes).enter() // ... specify node position, radius, etc. as we normally would</code></p>
<p>// 4. indicate how we should update the graph for each tick</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><code>sim.on("tick", () =\&gt; { // ... specify how we should move nodes/edges given new positional data })</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Step one</strong> is to create a copy of our initial node data (position, radius, etc.) so that we can pass this copy rather than our original data to <code>d3.forceSimulation()</code>. This is because as we simulate forces, the <code>d3.forceSimulation()</code> function will update whatever array of data we pass it to reflect how forces are influencing our nodes so if we have any intention of re-using our initial node data after we start simulating, we’ll want to copy it first. However, if you are only doing one simulation and do not need preserve the initial data, you don’t necessarily need to worry about copying your data.</p>
<p><strong>Step two</strong> is to actually make our simulation by first passing our (copied) array of data to <code>d3.forceSimulation()</code>. We can then add/chain whatever forces we would like to use with <code>force(...)</code> (more on this below). In our case, once we have defined the behavior of the simulation, we will then explictly stop the simulation before it has a chance to start so that we can specify how many frames or ticks we would like to run of our simulation. We do this below so that we can control where we are in the simulation with scrubbers, but without doing this, the simulation will simply start and continue to run on it’s own.</p>
<p><strong>Step three</strong> is to simply bind our data and draw our nodes as we would for any static graph. Because we are binding our nodes to the same data that is passed to <code>d3.forceSimulation()</code>, as our simulation runs, we can simply rely on the next and final step to update our nodes with new positioning.</p>
<p><strong>Step four</strong> is to end by indicating how we should update our nodes at each step as the simulation applies forces. The simulation will be updating the underlying positional data array (<code>nodes</code>) that is already bound to our drawn elements so we just have specify moving each node to its new position.</p>
