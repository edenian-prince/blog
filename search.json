    "text": "How to\nTypst in Quarto doesn’t work like latex. Instead of adding simple .tex partials to adjust minor things, you need to adjust .typ files.\n\nStart with the default Quarto typst template with quarto create typst and it will give you\n\na typst-show.typ file. I never edit this\na typst-template.typ file - this is where the customization magic happens\nmake sure you read the comments in the first lines of those files!!!!!\nreference these files in your yaml front matter like so:\n\n\n---\nformat:\n    typst: \n        template-partials:\n        - typst-template.typ\n        - typst-show.typ\n---\n\nif you want custom callout colors, you can change them in the typst-template.typ\n\nit helps to see the raw .typ output to understand where you need to change the color in typst. put keep_typ: true in your front matter:\n\n\n---\nformat:\n    typst: \n        template-partials:\n        - typst-template.typ\n        - typst-show.typ\n        keep-typ: true\n---\n\nnow render your document and look through the output .typ file for the callout block function\nwhen you find the callout block function, copy it and put it in your typst-template. you might need a basic understanding of Typst in order to see where to place the function. Put the function before the #let article function. it will look like this:\n\n#let callout(body: [], title: \"Callout\", background_color: rgb(\"#dddddd\"), icon: none, icon_color: rgb(\"#9cbe5b\")) = {\n  block(\n    breakable: false, \n    fill: rgb(\"#a6c72e\"), // I changed the color here\n    stroke: (paint: icon_color, thickness: 0.5pt, cap: \"round\"), \n    width: 100%, \n    radius: 2pt,\n    block(\n      inset: 1pt,\n      width: 100%, \n      below: 0pt, \n      block(\n        fill: rgb(\"#c03c14\"), \n        width: 100%, \n        inset: 8pt)[#text(icon_color, weight: 900)[#icon] #title]) +\n      if(body != []){\n        block(\n          inset: 1pt, \n          width: 100%, \n          block(fill: white, width: 100%, inset: 8pt, body))\n      }\n    )\n}\n\nNow you can change the fill colors and icon colors to whatever you want by adjusting them in that function.\n\n\nFrom here you can just render the qmd file and it should change the colors."

    "text": "Comparison to AWS Git Secrets\n\ngit-secrets doesn’t work like I expect out of the box\nAfter installing git-secrets and git-find, we can see that out of the box git-secrets doesn’t apply git hooks globally to existing repos. I have to manually adjust that on my own. That could be a good thing for experienced users that want local hooks first, but when we’re setting up hooks for new git users where the main concern is security leaks, we just want to apply the hooks to ALL of their repositories and not worry about them needing to potentially adjust their git settings.\nand to note, with git-secrets I added the provider like this:\ngit secrets --add-provider --global -- cat ./secrets_key\nwith git-find it’s just\ngit-find add-provider --path /path/to/secrets.txt\n\n\n\n\ngit-find can auto update the secret provider\nWith git-secrets I had to remind my teammates to manually update their regex provider files every time there was a new addition. For example, our team would add a new server to our workflow and we would need to add a regex to the provider list in order to prevent that server name from being accidentally hardcoded into the git repo.\nThis is a huge pain and a security risk to rely on asking git newbies to update their hook files. git-find does all of this automatically under the hood, and it lets you store your secrets file in a centralized location to ensure all of the team has access to the exact same hooks and recieve updates automatically.\n\nUnder the hood, when you add a provider:\ngit-find add-provider --path /path/to/secrets.txt\nIt will prompt the user to set up auto updates if the provider is in a local git repo. If the user inputs Yes, it will run git pull /secrets/repo/ to pull the latest updates whenever the user runs git commit, ensuring that they have the latest security updates\n\n\nhistory scanning\nThis is still a work in progress. Eventually I want to make a script that puts the secret scan results in a dataframe where the user can easily parse for any security leaks in a repo.\nIn the past I had some issues with git-secrets scanning tools. Not sure why, but it would take forever to scan big repos I think git-find has it sorted out, but it obviously doesn’t look faster here. I will continue to test and update this."

    "text": "TL;DR\n\nJimmy didn’t leave the power ranger behind, he became it.\n\n\nIf you watched this movie, you know that the ending is divisive. Either love it or hate it. I’ve been watching a lot of analyses on Jimmy’s character and I think a lot of them completely miss the point.\nSpike’s journey has two parts; 1) he learns about death/life, and 2) what it means to be a man. The characters in the movie offer their perspectives to teach him about the two topics: His father has a somewhat toxic perspective of what makes someone a man — he kills without emotion, he says the infected are soulless, he isolates from his wife, cheats, drinks his emotions away, and copes. He is the one that labels the muscular, bid dick infected as “alphas”. Contrarily, when we meet the doctor, we see a healthy take on what it is to be human. He doesn’t think the infected are soulless, he doesn’t shy away from death (specifically with Isla, unlike Jaime), and he doesn’t call them ‘alpha’. He treats them like they’re living beings, as they are.\nAll of this shows Spike what life and death are, and that his community is actually a toxic and a regressed society. He would rather live than waste away in a toxic community, like what Dr. Kelson taught him.\nNow jump to the ending. Jimmy shows up and it feels like we’re thrown into a completely different movie, pissing off a lot of viewers. But Jimmy is essential to the point of the film. Jimmy drives all of the lessons home.\nIn the beginning, Spike doesn’t pack his power ranger toy because it’s not what the society would label as ‘manly’. He thinks bringing it would be too boyish and immature. Jimmy contrasts that by showing that not only did he ‘pack the power ranger’, he metaphorically became one. This is where analyses break down and say “he never grew up, he’s still a child” or “this is how he copes” but I don’t buy either of them.\nThe whole movie presented us these toxic and traumatic perceptions of what it means to be an ‘alpha’ and shows us that it’s important to face death, cherish life, and stay true to who you are.\nAnd Jimmy embodies the message. His appearance doesn’t make him less of a man. He obliterates the perception of what is ‘alpha’ and what it is to be a man (and really, obliterates gender norms. He’s wearing a tiara on purpose..). Jimmy doesn’t follow what his dad taught him (symbolized by the upside down cross), and he faces death head on. Jaime is not an ‘alpha’, whatever that means. He feeds us a bullshit view about masculinity but deep down he cannot face death or cherish life. Not only does Jimmy face death, but he clearly lives life to its fullest.\nJimmy is not coping; the film critics are."

Hannah and Jim help Selena make the connection that love really is the cure.\nThe rage virus comes from society and its hate, its wars, its chaos. Even if there is love, the virus affects everyone and spreads fast. Just like IRL, hate online or in the street does affect us all. Selena struggles with this in the beginning - she rightfully doesn’t trust anyone, and it affects her relationships and kills her ability to actually live. When you’re surrounded by hate you have no choice but to protect yourself.\nHannah breaks this mentality. She shows Selena that they all need each other and that they all need to trust each other. And Jim shows her that “just” staying alive isn’t “as good as it gets”, but that openning up and loving is worth it.\nSelena becomes aware of what it means to live"

    "text": "Samson, Adam and Eve\nIn part one of 28 Years Later, Dr. Kelson treats the infected like the humans they really are while the rest of humanity abandons them and treats them like demons. He shows Spike how to have a healthy view of death and life. How to love. Spike’s journey shows that even if we’re in a ‘safe’ society, shielded from the outside horrors, we will still always be affected by the horrors outside unless we face them. Society can’t be segregated. If one group falls apart we all do.\nIn the Bone Temple, Dr. Kelson begins to experiment with teaching Samson how to love. He shows him art, music, dance, and he speaks to him. Even if it feels that Samson can’t hear him, he tells him stories. We start to see Samson change: he doesn’t kill Kelson, but keeps coming back for more. We might be tempted to think that this is addiction, that Samson really just cares about the morphine that Kelson tranquilizes him with, but in the midst of his high, we see Samson remember.\nSamson shows his first sign of awareness when he eats a blackberry (it seemed he was a meat eater prior to this) and wipes his hand on his cloth. And the cloth shows that he’s aware of his penis now and tries to cover it up. This is like the story of Adam and Eve where the devil tells Eve that if she eats the fruit she will not die, but she will gain awareness of good and evil.\nBut this time it isn’t a woman that gains consciousness. It’s a man. I think that is key to this new series; we’re shown that the old society values toxic masculinity; Jamie (although he is complicated and a caring father), kills without emotion, cheats on his wife, they call the infected things like “Alpha” because their muscles and big dicks.. and Eric the scandinavian soldier that tries to act tough saying he is a viking. Eric even shows how he feels about women, showing off to Spike about the woman he had and how he prioritizes her for her looks. Samson gaining consciousness here shows us that society needs to change its view of masculinity. And that women have already woken up, but now it’s men who need to wake up"

He’a trying to cling to a higher power to find truth amongst the chaos and unexplained. Kelson found that, religion aside, it’s love and patience and constant effort/experimenting with how to show that love that can cure someone of hate. Yes, science cured Samson, but I believe it had to be mixed with Kelson’s constant love and patience. It could not have happened in a cold laboratory. And I’m not sure if this is a flat out denouncement of religion, but gives us hope that we don’t have to cling to a higher power (whether satan or god) to heal ourselves. We can solve this with love and patience, and a little science.\nI feel bad for Jimmy. He was just as affected by the virus as the actual infected. He needed a role model like Kelson so badly, just like men now need better role models"

We can use this variable in our plot.\n\nI used D3.js to make the beeswarm plot\nuse Observable to design the plot (and chatGPT to guide you with the code)\nfor a D3.js introduction, you NEED to read this document\n\nespecially this part: it shows how D3 visuals are broken down into parts\n\n\n\nStructure of d3-force simulations Before we dive into the specific forces that we’ll use, let’s briefly discuss the general structure used to create a force-directed graph.\n\n\n// 1. create a copy of the node data nodes = node_data.map(d =\\&gt; Object.create(d))\n// 2. create new force simulation specifying the forces to use // and, in our case, how many “ticks” or frames we’ll want to simulate\n\nsim = d3.forceSimulation(nodes) .force(\"force_name\", ...) // ... chain together as many forces as we want .stop() .tick(n_frames_to_simulate)\n\n// 3. bind data and draw nodes node = svg.selectAll(\".node\") .data(nodes).enter() // ... specify node position, radius, etc. as we normally would\n// 4. indicate how we should update the graph for each tick\n\n\nsim.on(\"tick\", () =\\&gt; { // ... specify how we should move nodes/edges given new positional data })\n\n\nStep one is to create a copy of our initial node data (position, radius, etc.) so that we can pass this copy rather than our original data to d3.forceSimulation(). This is because as we simulate forces, the d3.forceSimulation() function will update whatever array of data we pass it to reflect how forces are influencing our nodes so if we have any intention of re-using our initial node data after we start simulating, we’ll want to copy it first. However, if you are only doing one simulation and do not need preserve the initial data, you don’t necessarily need to worry about copying your data.\nStep two is to actually make our simulation by first passing our (copied) array of data to d3.forceSimulation(). We can then add/chain whatever forces we would like to use with force(...) (more on this below). In our case, once we have defined the behavior of the simulation, we will then explictly stop the simulation before it has a chance to start so that we can specify how many frames or ticks we would like to run of our simulation. We do this below so that we can control where we are in the simulation with scrubbers, but without doing this, the simulation will simply start and continue to run on it’s own.\nStep three is to simply bind our data and draw our nodes as we would for any static graph. Because we are binding our nodes to the same data that is passed to d3.forceSimulation(), as our simulation runs, we can simply rely on the next and final step to update our nodes with new positioning.\nStep four is to end by indicating how we should update our nodes at each step as the simulation applies forces. The simulation will be updating the underlying positional data array (nodes) that is already bound to our drawn elements so we just have specify moving each node to its new position."

    "text": "What you need to do - put it together\nI went back and forth with chatGPT a lot, and I read a lot of documentation to make the visual. But it was worth it. I feel like I have a better understanding of D3.\n\nFor my beeswarm plot, I make a base plot that has minimal D3 forces applied to it, it looks like this:\n\n// Initialize simulation with the base forces\n    const sim = d3\n      .forceSimulation(node_data)\n      .force(\"x\", d3.forceX(d =&gt; xScale(new Date(d.create_date))))  // Position along the X-axis based on create_date\n      .force(\"collide\", d3.forceCollide().radius(d =&gt; radiusScale(d.commits) + 1).strength(0.5));  // Default collision force\n\nThen I used the scan variable I created above that is linked to closeread’s scroll trigger to dynamically add new D3 forces to the plot:\n\n// If `scan &gt; 1`, apply additional forces for language grouping\nif (scan &gt; 1) {\n  // Apply additional y-force to divide nodes by language\n  sim.force(\"y\", d3.forceY(d =&gt; yScale(d.language) + 70))  // Position nodes along y-axis based on language\n    .force(\"collide\", d3.forceCollide().radius(d =&gt; radiusScale(d.commits) + 1).strength(0.8));  // Adjust collision force\n\n  // Create x-axis for years\n  const xAxis = d3.axisBottom(xScale).tickFormat(d3.timeFormat(\"%Y\"));\n  const xAxisGroup = svg.append(\"g\")\n  .attr(\"transform\", `translate(0, ${chart_param.height - chart_param.margin.bottom})`)\n  .call(xAxis);\n\n    // Style x-axis labels (make them bold and larger)\n    xAxisGroup.selectAll(\"text\")\n    .attr(\"font-size\", \"16px\")    // Set font size to 16px or any value you prefer\n    .attr(\"font-weight\", \"bold\"); // Make the labels bold\n\n    // Create y-axis for language groups\n    const yAxis = d3.axisLeft(yScale);\n    const yAxisGroup = svg.append(\"g\")\n    .attr(\"transform\", `translate(${chart_param.margin.left}, 0)`)\n    .call(yAxis);\n    \n    // Style y-axis labels (make them bold and larger)\n    yAxisGroup.selectAll(\"text\")\n    .attr(\"font-size\", \"15px\")    // Set font size to 16px or any value you prefer\n    .attr(\"font-weight\", \"bold\"); // Make the labels bold\n  \n} else {\n  // For `scan === 1`, apply the default force with no language division\n  sim.force(\"y\", d3.forceY(chart_param.height / 2))  // All nodes at the center of Y-axis\n    .force(\"collide\", d3.forceCollide().radius(d =&gt; radiusScale(d.commits) + 1).strength(0.5));  // Default collision force\n\n  // Create x-axis for years\n  const xAxis = d3.axisBottom(xScale).tickFormat(d3.timeFormat(\"%Y\"));\n  const xAxisGroup = svg.append(\"g\")\n  .attr(\"transform\", `translate(0, ${chart_param.height - chart_param.margin.bottom})`)\n  .call(xAxis);\n\n// Style x-axis labels (make them bold and larger)\nxAxisGroup.selectAll(\"text\")\n  .attr(\"font-size\", \"16px\")    // Set font size to 16px or any value you prefer\n  .attr(\"font-weight\", \"bold\"); // Make the labels bold\n\n}\n\nYou can see a conditional statement: when scan &gt;1 then the plot will get split into a plot by the language variable, and a new y axis will be added to the plot. Else, when scan === 1 then the plot has a base force with the regular x axis only"
