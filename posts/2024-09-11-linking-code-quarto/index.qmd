# Who is this for
this post is for people you identify with these points:

- you want to execute code in your documentation
- you want to include an external code chunk in your documentation
- you use quarto
- you use rmarkdown
- you use sphinx
- you are writing documentation for a package

# Why link code to your docs

1. you can execute code to conditionally change your document
2. you can modularize your documentation
3. you can have your **documentation automatically update whenever your code base changes**

# Examples
