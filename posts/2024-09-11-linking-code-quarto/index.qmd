This post will cover how to link your codebase to your documentation. 

# Who is this for
this post is for people you identify with these points:

- you want to execute code in your documentation
- you want to include an external code chunk in your documentation
- you use quarto
- you use rmarkdown
- you use sphinx
- you are writing documentation for a package

# Why link code to your docs

1. you can execute code to conditionally change your document
2. you can modularize your documentation
3. you can have your **documentation automatically update whenever your code base changes**

# Examples

Table of Contents: 

1. Auto link your codebase @sec-codebase
2. Link external code to documentation
3. Include chunks to your documentation
3. Quarto Manuscripts - link notebooks to your manuscript


# Auto link code to package docs {#sec-codebase}

Most R packages have great documentation thanks to the standard framework set by `pkgdown`. `pkgdown` can easily set up documentation for a custom R package that automatically links the functions in your code to your documention (usually as a Github Page doc). 

Mainstream python packages usually have good documentation too, and many are written via `sphinx`, a framework that is similar to `pkgdown` in many ways.
